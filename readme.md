*(A screenshot of the HTML output of the Delta airlines U.S. route map I created using this program. Note that this map likely does not reflect Delta's actual route map; see the methodology used to create the map within route_maps_builder_v2.ipynb for more details.)*

This repository shows how to generate airline route maps using publicly available route and airport data. I plan to add additional documentation at a later date, and to demonstrate how to create maps using Folium.

**Note**: The following files were not included in the GitHub repository because their size exceeds 100MB:
1. routes_planes_coordinates.csv
2. routes_planes_coordinates_for_mapping.csv
3. 21503323_T_T100_SEGMENT_ALL_CARRIER.csv
4. routes_planes_coordinates_for_mapping_v2.csv (particularly important for creating the actual route maps)
 
You can instead retrieve these files from my copy of this project on Google Drive, available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jRTjoZtT6OWCXRTNstG9D4CxmjXe4W8q?usp=sharing .
